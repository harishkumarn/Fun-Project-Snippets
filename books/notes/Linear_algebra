Linear algebra by Prof. Gilbert Strang

*)System of linear equations :
-how to solve?
-> By treating them(Rows) as equations of lines/planes for 2D/3D span. (Row method)
-> By treating columns as matrices (Column method)

*Row method : Intuition
-> solution would be the intersection point of lines/planes
*Column method : Intuition
->solution would be obtained by vector scaling and addition. Else we can use elimination
 Can I solve B for all X (AX=B). But, do all combinations of the columns fill the 3-D space (or N-D space). If yes, then possible. Means, A is a non-singular matrix, invertible matrix (i.e., |A|>0)


To solve the equation


*)Matrix elimination
-why?
->to solve the system of linear equation
-How?
->By getting the matrix to reduced row echelon form (upper or lower triangular matrix) we can solve the system of linear equations through back substitution

*)Matrix inversion
-> AA-1 = I. A matrix can have an inverse only if |A| >0 . Only then it is invertible
->ways to multiply a matrix :

1. let C=AB

Cid = âˆ‘i'th row of A*j'th column of B

2. A Row * Matrix = a row
3. Matrix * Column = a Column
4. A column * a Row = 

5. Block method : Divide matrices A,B into blocks of equals sizes. Then treat each block as an element of a matrix.

-> let A, B be 2 4x4 matrices. Divide them into blocks of size 2x2. Let the blocks be A00,A01,A10, A11 and vice versa for B.

Then C00 = A00*B00 + A01*B10


-Matrix inversion methods:

->Gauss-Jordan Elimination:

Let A be,

a b
c d

& I be

1 0
0 1


Augmented Matrix is

 a b 1 0 
 c d 0 1

Through  Gauss-Jordan Elimination, we get

 1 0 l m
 0 1 n o

The matrix [[l,m],[n,o]] is the inverse matrix for the matrix A.
